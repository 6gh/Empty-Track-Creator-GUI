# Empty Track Creator GUI
A simple GUI to go with [Empty Track Creator](https://github.com/6gh/Empty-Track-Creator)

## Not the true program

If you want to use this program, you will have to [download the CLI version](https://github.com/6gh/Empty-Track-Creator/releases/latest) first and place it in the same directory as the GUI

Developement will continue in that repository, while the GUI counterpart will be updated only when (and if) there are more options added in the future

## Usage

Open the GUI program, and choose your options. Then click Create to start. The output box will contain the output of the CLI exe. It will also display the command being used to make the MIDI for your convenience.
